1st: created 1st hand tracking and drawing prototype

2nd: -enhanced the jitter (shaking of the handwriting) by applying a smoothing factor -> instead of jumping directly 	from previous position of the tip to the next, now with a factor of 0.5 we follow the point in the middle of 	the line between the previous and new position, 
     -added a finger counting logic for decision making -> 1) write only when index tip is up
							   2) palm shown (5 fingers up) trigger classifier and remove
							   3) else do nothing or stop writing

 
3rd: -enhanced the classifier input logic for easier and smoother training and decision making -> added a transparent 	canvas (black board that is unseen for the user), this black board will be used for model input instead of trying to detect and isolating the drown letter
